Online Clothing System
Project Overview
The Online Clothing System is a responsive, frontend-only web application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to log in, browse a catalog of clothing items, add products to a cart, and place orders. The application is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and fully responsive across devices, leveraging Bootstrap for modern styling and JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
Features

Product Catalog: Displays clothing items with images, descriptions, and prices.
Add to Cart: Users can select products and add them to a virtual cart with dynamic updates.
Order Placement: Users can review their cart and place orders (frontend simulation).
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Interactive UI: JavaScript handles dynamic cart updates and user interactions for a smooth experience.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structures the web pages and content.
CSS (Bootstrap): Provides responsive design and modern styling.

Limitations

This is a frontend-only demo without backend connectivity or database integration.
User login and order placement are simulated and do not persist data.
No payment processing or real-time order tracking is implemented.

Future Improvements

Integrate a backend (e.g., PHP, Node.js) for user authentication and data persistence.
Add a database (e.g., MySQL) to store user and product information.
Implement payment gateway integration for real order processing.
Enhance product filtering and search functionality.
